# CIE_Classroom_Allotment

INTRODUCTION

It was a team project, my contribution was that I designed algorithm which allots the classrooms to teachers and students according to the availability of rooms and also designed database and wrote queries how list will be generated, stored and displayed to teachers and students

WORKING

1. Take input on the list of students, teachers, number of rooms and seats, exams and teachers free slot.
2. With the help of algorithm the project will allot the rooms for each exam,student and teacher accordingly.
3. Create an Admin interface, where he/she can input the student,teacher,rooms,exam and teachers free slot list and can also update that and also upload it to database.
4. And after uploading it to database it can generate student room allocation and teacher room allocation.
5. This allocations are done by writing sql queries.
6. There is a Teacher and Student interface, where they can find their allotted room.
